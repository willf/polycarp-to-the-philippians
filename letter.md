## Introduction

**\intro:1:el** Πολύκαρπος καὶ οἱ σὺν αὐτῳ πρεσβύτεροι τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ τοῦ θεοῦ τῇ παροικούσῃ Φιλίππους· ἔλεος ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη παρὰ θεοῦ παντοκράτορος καὶ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τοῦ σωτῆρος ἡμῶν πληθυνθείη.

**\intro:1:en.1** Polycarp, and the elders with him, to the Church of God sojourning at Philippi: Mercy to you, and peace from God Almighty, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior, be multiplied.

**\intro:1:en.2** Polycarp and the presbyters with him, to the church of God, the one temporarily residing in Philippi. Mercy to you and peace from God the all-powerful and Jesus Christ our Savior be multiplied.

**\intro:1.en.3** From Polycarp and the elders with him, to God's church sojourning in Philippi. May mercy and peace be yours in aabundance, from God Almighty and the Jesus Christ our savior.

**\intro:1.comment** It's interesting that P. sees the church as 'sojourning' in Philippi. I assume he means this in a literal but figurative sense; that is, they won't be there long, but it's not as if they are planning to move soon to another city. I wonder how the parallelism goes. See Jude 1. (KJV Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied). Is "Christ" a title or a "last name" here? Why does "Lord" show up in the first English translation?

## Chapter 1 In praise of the Philippians for their faith and love

**\1:1:el** Συνεχάρην ὑμῖν μεγάλως ἐν τῷ κυρίῳ ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ, δεξαμένοις τὰ μιμήματα τῆς ἀληθοῦς ἀγάπης καὶ προπέμψασιν, ὡς ἐπέβαλεν ὑμῖν, τοὺς ἐνειλημένους τοῖς ἁγιοπρεπέσιν δεσμοῖς, ἅτινά ἐστιν διαδήματα τῶν ἀληθῶς ὑπὸ θεοῦ καὶ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν ἐκλελεγμένων·

**\1:1:en.1** I have greatly rejoiced with you in our Lord Jesus Christ, because you have followed the example of true love [as displayed by God], and have accompanied, as became you, those who were bound in chains, the fitting ornaments of saints, and which are indeed the diadems of the true elect of God and our Lord;

**\1:1:en.2** I rejoice with you greatly in our Lord Jesus Christ, having welcomed the replicas of true love and having sent on their way, as was incumbent upon you, those confined by chains fitting for saints which are the crowns of those truly chosen by God and our Lord.

**\1:1:en.3** I greatly rejoice with you, in our Lord Jesus Christ, because you welcomed those who are true examples of love, as you ought — those who were shackled with chains, fitting ornaments of saints, and the crowns of those truly chosen by our God and our Lord.

**\1:1.comment** The following agents: Polycarp, the church, and the imprisoned. Polycarp and the church rejoice because they can welcome the imprisoned. The imprisoned are "true examples of love," as shown by their shackles, which God will turn into crowns.

**\1:2:el** καὶ ὅτι ἡ βεβαία τῆς πίστεως ὑμῶν ῥίζα, ἐξ ἀρχαίων καταγγελλομένη χρόνων, μέχρι νῦν διαμένει καὶ καρποφορεῖ εἰς τὸν κύριον ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦν Χριστόν, ὃς ὑπέμεινεν ὑπὲρ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν ἕως θανάτου κατανῆσαι, ὃν ἤγειρεν ὁ θεός, λύσας τὰς ὠδῖνας τοῦ ᾅδου·

**\1:2:en.1** and because the strong root of your faith, spoken of in days long gone by, endures even until now, and brings forth fruit to our Lord Jesus Christ, who for our sins suffered even unto death, [but] “whom God raised from the dead, having loosed the bands of the grave.”

**\1:2:en.2** And because of the secure root of our faith, being proclaimed from ancient times, {still continues} and bears fruit to our Lord Jesus Christ, who endured because of our sins to reach even death, whom God raised up having loosed the birth pains of Hades.

**\1:2:en.3** And because we are strongly rooted in our faith, which has been proclaimed since long ago, but which continues to endure and bear fruit for our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for our sins, but "whom God raised up, having broken the bands of the grave."

**\1:2:comment** Birth pangs? Bands? But more reasons to rejoice together; we are part of a story that started a long time ago and continues until now, having started with Jesus's death and resurrection.

**\1:3:el**  εἰς ὃν οὐκ ἰδόντες πιστεύετε χαρᾷ ἀνεκλαλήτῳ δεδοξασμένῃ, εἰς ἣν πολλοὶ ἐπιθυμοῦσιν εἰσελθεῖν, εἰδότες, ὅτι χάριτί ἐστε σεσωσμένοι, οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων, ἀλλὰ θελήματι θεοῦ διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ.

**\1:3:en.1** “In whom, though now ye see Him not, ye believe, and believing, rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory;" into which joy many desire to enter, knowing that “by grace ye are saved, not of works,” but by the will of God through Jesus Christ.

**\1:2:en.2** In whom, not having seen, you believe with joy inexpressible and glorious, which many long to experience, knowing that by grace you have been saved, not by works, but the will of God through Jesus Christ.

**\1:2:en.3** You have never seen him, but you believe with glorious, unspeakable joy. Many long for this experience. But you know that you have been not been saved by anything you have done, but by the will of God, through Jesus Christ.

**\1:2:comment** How often do we feel this joy?

## Chapter 2 An Exhortation to Virtue

**\2:1:el** Διὸ ἀναζωσάμενοι τὰς ὀσφύας ὑμῶν δουλεύσατε τῷ θεῷ ἐν φόβῳ καὶ ἀληθείᾳ ἀπολιπόντες τὴν κενὴν ματαιολογίαν καὶ τὴν τῶν πολλῶν πλάνην, πιστεύσαντες εἰς τὸν ἐγείραντα τὸν κύριον ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν καὶ δόντα αὐτῷ δόξαν καὶ θρόνον ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ· ᾧ πᾶσα πνοὴ λατρεύει, ὃς ἔρχεται κριτῆς ζώντων καὶ νεκρῶν, οὗ τὸ αἷμα ἐκζητήσει ὁ θεὸς ἀπὸ τῶν ἀπειθούντων αὐτῷ.

**\2:1:en.1** “Wherefore, girding up your loins,” “serve the Lord in fear” and truth, as those who have forsaken the vain, empty talk and error of the multitude, and “believed in Him who raised up our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, and gave Him glory,” and a throne at His right hand. To Him all things” in heaven and on earth are subject. Him every spirit serves. He comes as the Judge of the living and the dead. His blood will God require of those who do not believe in Him.

**\2:1:en.2** Therefore {prepare yourselves}.7 Serve God in reverence and truth, leaving behind empty, fruitless talk and the deception of the crowd, believing in the one who raised our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead and gave him glory and a throne at his right hand, to whom all things in heaven and earth are subject, whom every breathing thing worships, who is coming as judge of the living and dead, whose blood God will require from those who disobey him.

**\2:1:en.3** So, get ready. Serve God with awe, and in truth. Leave behind empty and fruitless talk and the errors of the crowd. Believe in the who who raised our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead and gave him glory and a throne at his right hand; to whom all things, in heaven and on earth, are subject;  whom every being worships; who comes as the judge of the living and the dead; and whose blood will be required from those who disobey him.

**\2:1:comment** What does it mean to "require Jesus's blood" from those who disobey Jesus? Sounds like punishment.

**\2:2:el**  ὁ δὲ ἐγείρας αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐγερεῖ, ἐὰν ποιῶμεν αὐτοῦ καὶ πορευώμεθα ἐν ταῖς ἐντολαῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀγαπῶμεν ἃ ἠγάπησεν, ἀπεχόμενοι πάσης ἀδικίας, πλεονεξίας, φιλαργυρίας, καταλαλιᾶς, ψευδομαρτυρίας· μὴ ἀποδιδόντες κακὸν ἀντὶ κακοῦ ἢ λοιδορίαν ἀντὶ λοιδορίας ἢ γρόνθου ἀντὶ γρόνθου ἢ κατάραν ἀντὶ κατάρας·

**\2:2:en.1** But He who raised Him up from the dead will raise up us also, if we do His will, and walk in His commandments, and love what He loved, keeping ourselves from all unrighteousness, covetousness, love of money, evil speaking, false witness; “not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing,” or blow for blow, or cursing for cursing,

**\2:2:en.2** But the one who raised him from the dead also will raise us if we do his will and follow in his commandments and love the things he loved—refraining from all unrighteousness, greediness, love of money, evil speech, [and] false witness, not paying back evil for evil or abuse for abuse or blow for blow or curse for curse,

**\2:2:en.3** But the one who raised him from the dead will also raise us if we do his will and follow in his commandments and love the things he loved—refraining from all unrighteousness, greediness, love of money, evil speech, and false witness; not paying back evil for evil, abuse for abuse, blow for blow, or curse for curse.

**\2:3:el** μνημονεύοντες δὲ ὧν εἶπεν ὁ κύριος διδάσκων· Μὴ κρίνετε, ἵνα μὴ κριθῆτε· ᾧ μέτρῳ μετρεῖτε, ἀντιμετρηθήσεται ὑμῖν· καὶ ὅτι μακάριοι οἱ πτωχοὶ καὶ οἱ διωκόμενοι ἕνεκεν δικαιοσύνης, ὅτι αὐτῶν ἐστὶν ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ θεοῦ.

**\2:3:en.1** but being mindful of what the Lord said in His teaching: “Judge not, that ye be not judged; forgive, and it shall be forgiven unto you; be merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; with what measure ye measure out, it shall be measured to you again; and once more, “Blessed are the poor, and those that are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of God.”

**\2:3:en.2** but remembering what the Lord said when he taught: Do not judge so that you may not be judged; forgive and then you will be forgiven; show mercy so that you will be shown mercy; with what measure you measure out it will be measured again to you; and that blessed [are] the poor and those being persecuted for the sake of righteousness; for theirs is the kingdom of God.

**\2:3:en.3** Rather, remember what the Lord said when he taught: Do not judge so that you may not be judged; forgive and then you will be forgiven; show mercy so that you will be shown mercy; with what measure you measure out it will be measured again to you; and how blessed are the poor and the persecuted for the sake of righteousness; for theirs is the kingdom of God.

**\2:3:comment** Negative and positive action. Don't judge, but forgive.  Don't repay evil, but show mercy.  Don't be greedy, but be poor.  Don't speak evil, but speak the truth.  Don't lie, but speak the truth.  Don't curse, but bless.  Don't be angry, but be patient.  Don't be bitter, but be kind.  Don't be proud, but be humble.  Don't be selfish, but be selfless.  Don't be a hypocrite, but be sincere.  Don't be a coward, but be brave.  Don't be a liar, but be a truth-teller.  Don't be a thief, but be a giver.

## Chapter 3 Expressions of Personal Unworthiness

**\3:1:el** Ταῦτα, ἀδελφοί, οὐκ ἐμαυτῷ ἐπτρέψας γράφω ὑμῖν περὶ τῆς δικαιοσύνης, ἀλλ’ ἐπεὶ ὑμεῖς προεπεκαλέσασθέ με.

**\3:1:en.1** These things, brethren, I write to you concerning righteousness, not because I take anything upon myself, but because ye have invited me to do so.

**\3:1:en.2** Brothers, I write these things to you concerning righteousness {not on my own initiative}, but because you requested [it] of me.

**\3:1:en.3** Brothers, I am writing about righteousness, not because I want to, but because you asked me to.

**\3:1.comment** A humble man.

**\3:2:el** οὔτε γὰρ ἐγὼ οὔτε ἄλλος ὅμοιος ἐμοὶ δύναται κατακολουθῆσαι τῇ σοφίᾳ τοῦ μακαρίου καὶ ἐνδόξου Παύλου, ὃς γενόμενος ἐν ὑμῖν κατὰ πρόσωπον τῶν τότε ἀνθρώπων ἐδίδαξεν ἀκριβῶς καὶ βεβαίως τὸν περὶ ἀληθείας λόγον, ὃς καὶ ἀπὼν ὑμῖν ἔγραψεν ἐπιστολάς, εἰς ἃς ἐὰν εγκύπτητε, δυνηθήσεσθε οἰκοδομεῖσθαι εἰς τὴν δοθεῖσαν ὑμῖν πίστιν·

**\3:2:en.1** For neither I, nor any other such one, can come up to the wisdom of the blessed and glorified Paul. He, when among you, accurately and steadfastly taught the word of truth in the presence of those who were then alive. And when absent from you, he wrote you letters, which, if you carefully study, you will find to be the means of building you up in that faith

**\3:2:en.2** For neither I nor another like me is able to follow after the wisdom of the blessed and glorious Paul, who, when he was with you in the presence of the people at that time, he taught the word of truth accurately and reliably, who also being absent he wrote letters to you regarding which, if you examine [them], you will be able to build yourselves up in the faith given to you,

**\3:2:en.3** No one, neither I nor anyone else, can come up to the standard of wisdom set by the blessed and glorious Paul, who, when he was with you, taught the word of truth accurately and reliably. And when he was absent, he wrote letters to you, which, if you carefully study, you will find to be the means of building yourselves up in the faith given to you.

**\3:3:el** ἥτις ἐστὶν μήτηρ πάντων ἡμῶν, ἐπακολουθούσης τῆς ἐλπίδος, προαγούσης τῆς εἰς θεὸν καὶ Χριστὸν καὶ εἰς τὸν πλησίον. ἐὰν γάρ τις τούτων ἐντὸς ᾖ, πεπλήρωκεν ἐντολὴν δικαιοσύνης· ὁ γὰρ ἔχων ἀγάπην μακράν ἐστιν πάσης ἁμαρτίας.

**\3:3:en.1** which has been given you, and which, being followed by hope, and preceeded by love towards God, and Christ, and our neighbor, “is the mother of us all.” For if any one be inwardly possessed of these graces, he hath fulfilled the command of righteousness, since he that hath love is far from all sin.

**\3:3:en.2** which is the mother of all of us, while hope follows after [and] the love which [is] for God and Christ and for the neighbor goes before . For if {anyone is in their company}, he has fulfilled the commandment of righteousness, for he who has love is a long way from all sin.

**\3:3:en.3** That faith which is the mother of us all, followed by hope, then by the love for God and Christ and for our neighbor. For if anyone is in their company, they have fulfilled the commandment of righteousness, for all who have love are a long way from every sin.

**\3:3.comment** Pay attention to Paul! Who will instruct you in righteousness. Live a life of love, hope, and faith. (Interesting that Paul doesn't mention the beatitudes, though.)

## Chapter 4 Various Exhortations

**\4:1:el** Ἀρχὴ δὲ πάντων χαλεπῶν φιλαργυρία. εἰδότες οὖν ὅτι οὐδὲν εἰσηνέγκαμεν εἰς τὸν κόσμον, ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ ἐξενεγκεῖν τι ἔχομεν, ὁπλισώμεθα τοῖς ὅπλοις τῆς δικαιοσύνης καὶ διδάξωμεν ἑαυτοὺς πρῶτον προεύεσθαι ἐν τῇ ἐντολῇ τοῦ κυριοῦ·

**\4:1:en.1** “But the love of money is the root of all evils.” Knowing, therefore, that “as we brought nothing into the world, so we can carry nothing out,” let us arm ourselves with the armor of righteousness; and let us teach, first of all, ourselves to walk in the commandments of the Lord.

**\4:1:en.2** But the beginning of all difficulty [is] the love of money. Knowing, therefore, that we have brought nothing into the world, and neither are we able to take anything out, let us arm ourselves with the weapons of righteousness and let us teach ourselves first to follow in the commandment of the Lord.

**\4:1:en.3** Money is the root of all kinds of evil. We know that we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of it. So let us arm ourselves with the weapons of righteousness, and let us teach ourselves first to follow the commandments of the Lord.

**\4:2:el** ἔπειτα καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας ἡμῶν ἐν τῇ δοθείσῃ αὐταῖς πίστει καὶ ἀγάπῃ καὶ ἁγνείᾳ στεργούσας τοὺς ἑαυτῶν ἄνδρας ἐν πάσῃ ἀληθείᾳ καὶ ἀγαπώσας πάντας ἐξ ἴσου ἐν πάσῃ ἐγκρατείᾳ, καὶ τὰ τέκνα παιδεύειν τὴν παιδείαν τοῦ φόβου τοῦ θεοῦ·

**\4:2:en.1** Next, [teach] your wives [to walk] in the faith given to them, and in love and purity tenderly loving their own husbands in all truth, and loving all [others] equally in all chastity; and to train up their children in the knowledge and fear of God.

**\4:2:en.2** Then also [teach] your wives [to walk] in the faith given to them, and in love and in purity, feeling affection for their own husbands in all fidelity and loving all others equally in all chastity, and to instruct their children with the instruction of the fear of God.

**\4:2:en.3** Then also teach married women to walk in their faith, and in love and in purity, feeling affection for their own husbands in all fidelity and loving all others equally in all chastity, and to instruct their children with the instruction of the fear of God.

**\4:3:el** τὰς χήρας σωφρονούσας περὶ τὴν τοῦ κυρίου πίστιν, ἐντυγχανούσας ἀδιαλείπτως περὶ πάντων, μακρὰν οὔσας πάσης διαβολῆς, καταλαλιᾶς, ψευδομαρτυρίας, φιλαργυρίας καὶ παντὸς κακοῦ, γινωσκούσας ὅτι εἰσὶ θυσιαστήριον θεοῦ καὶ ὅτι πάντα μωμοσκοπεῖται, καὶ λέληθεν αὐτὸν οὐδὲν οὔτε λογισμῶν οὔτε ἐννοιῶν οὔτε τι τῶν κρυπτῶν τῆς καρδίας.

**\4:3:en.1** Teach the widows to be discreet as respects the faith of the Lord, praying continually for all, being far from all slandering, evil-speaking, false-witnessing, love of money, and every kind of evil; knowing that they are the altars of God, that He clearly perceives all things, and that nothing is hidden from Him, neither reasonings, nor reflections, nor any one of the secret things of the heart.

**\4:3:en:2** The widows, being sensible concerning the faith of the Lord, interceding unceasingly for everyone, being far removed from all slander, evil speech, false witness, love of money, and every kind of evil, knowing that they are an altar of God, and that each [sacrifice] is examined for blemishes and nothing {escapes his notice}, neither reasonings nor thoughts nor any secrets of the heart.

**\4:3:en.3** And teach the widows to be discreet as respects the faith of the Lord, praying continually for everyone, staying away from slander, evil speech, false-witness, love of money, and every kind of evil; knowing that they are the altars of God, that He clearly perceives all things, and that nothing escapes his notice, not thought, not reflections, nor any one of the secret things of the heart.

**\4:3:comment** Warning against money, teaching about wives and widows.

## Chapter 5 The Duties of Deacons, Youths, and Virgins

**\5:1:el** Εἰδότες, οὖν ὅτι θεὸς οὐ μυκτηρίζεται, ὀφείλομεν ἀξίως τῆς ἐντολῆς αὐτοῦ καὶ δόξης περιπατεῖν.

**\5:1:en.1** Knowing, then, that “God is not mocked,” we ought to walk worthy of His commandment and glory.

**\5:1:en.2** Understanding, therefore, that God is not mocked,26 we ought to walk in a manner worthy of his commandment and glory.

**\5:1:en.3** Knowing, therefore, that God is not mocked, we ought to walk in a manner worthy of his commandment and glory.

**\5:2:el** ὁμοίως διάκονοι ἄμεμπτοι κατενώπιον αὐτοῦ τῆς δικαιοσύνης ὡς θεοῦ καὶ Χριστοῦ διάκονοι καὶ οὐκ ἀνθρώπων· μὴ διαβολοι, μὴ δίλογοι ἀφιλάργυροι, ἐγκρατεῖς περὶ πάντα, εὔσπλαγχνοι, ἐπιμελεῖς, πορευόμενοι κατὰ τὴν ἀλήθειαν τοῦ κυρίου, ὃς ἐγένετο διάκονος πάντων· ᾧ ἐὰν εὐαρεστήσωμεν ἐν τῷ νῦν αἰῶνι, ἀποληψόμεθα καὶ τὸν μέλλοντα, καθὼς ὑπέσχετο ἡμῖν ἐγεῖραι ἡμᾶς ἐκ νεκρῶν, καὶ ὅτι ἐὰν πολιτευσώμεθα ἀξίως αὐτοῦ, καὶ συμβασιλεύσομεν αὐτῷ, ἔγε πιστεύομεν.

**\5:2:en.1** In like manner should the deacons be blameless before the face of His righteousness, as being the servants of God and Christ, and not of men. They must not be slanderers, two-faced, or lovers of money, but temperate in all things, compassionate, industrious, walking according to the truth of the Lord, who was the servant of all. If we please Him in this present world, we shall receive also the future world, according as He has promised to us that He will raise us again from the dead, and that if we live worthily of Him, “we shall also reign together with Him,” provided only we believe.

**\5:2:en.2** Likewise, deacons [must be] blameless in the presence of his righteousness, as servants of God and Christ and not of people, not slanderers, not insincere, not lovers of money, self-controlled in all things, compassionate, careful, walking according to the truth of the Lord, who became the servant of all. If we please him in this present age, we will receive also that which is to come, just as he promised us, to raise us from the dead, and that if we conduct our lives in a manner worthy of him, we will also reign with him, if indeed we have faith.

**\5:2:en.3** Likewise, deacons must be blameless in the presence of his righteousness, as servants of God and Christ and not of the people, not slanderers, not insincere, not lovers of money, self-controlled in all things, compassionate, careful, walking according to the truth of the Lord, who became the servant of all. If we please him in this present age, we will receive also that which is to come, just as he promised us, to raise us from the dead, and that if we conduct our lives in a manner worthy of him, we will also reign with him, if indeed we have faith.

**\5:3:el** ὁμοίως καὶ νεώτεροι ἄμεμπτοι ἐν πᾶσιν, πρὸ παντὸς προνοοῦντες ἁγνείας καὶ χαλιναγωγοῦντες ἑαυτοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν ἐπιθυμιῶν ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ, ὅτι πᾶσα ἐπιθυμία κατὰ τοῦ πνεύματος στρατεύεται, καὶ οὔτε πόρνοι οὔτε μαλακοὶ οὔτε ἀρσενοκοῖται βασιλείαν θεοῦ κληρονομήσουσιν, οὔτε οἱ ποιοῦντες τὰ ἄτοπα. διό δέον ἀπέχεσθαι ἀπὸ πάντων τούτων, ὑποτασσομένους τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις καὶ διακόνοις ὡς θεῷ καὶ Χριστῷ· τὰς παρθένους ἐν ἀμώμῳ καὶ ἁγνῇ συνειδήσει περιπατεῖν.

**\5:3:en.1** In like manner, let the young men also be blameless in all things, being especially careful to preserve purity, and keeping themselves in, as with a bridle, from every kind of evil. For it is well that they should be cut off from the lusts that are in the world, since “every lust warreth against the spirit; “ and “neither fornicators, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, shall inherit the kingdom of God,” nor those who do things inconsistent and unbecoming. Wherefore, it is needful to abstain from all these things, being subject to the presbyters and deacons, as unto God and Christ. The virgins also must walk in a blameless and pure conscience.

**\5:3:en.2** Likewise also, the younger men [must be] blameless in all things; above all being concerned about purity and holding themselves in check from all evil. For [it is] good to abstain from sinful passions in the world because all sinful passion wages war against the spirit, and neither the sexually immoral, nor the passive homosexual partner, nor the dominant homosexual partner will inherit the kingdom of God; nor those who engage in perversity. Therefore it is necessary to refrain from all these things, being subject to the presbyters and deacons as to God and Christ. The virgins must conduct themselves with a blameless and pure conscience.

**\5:3:en.3** The young men, too, much be blameless in everything. Above all, they should be concerned to remain pure and to bridle all evil. It is good to abstain from the sinful passions of the world because every sinful passion wages war against the spirit. Those who sexually immoral will not inherit the kingdom of God, especially those who are perverse. It is necessary to abstain from such things, and be obedient to your elders and deacons as to God and Christ. So, too, young women must conduct themselves with a pure and blameless conscience.

### Chapter 6 The Duties of Elders and Others

**\6:1:el** Καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι δὲ εὔσπλαγχνοι εἰς πάντας ἐλεήμονες, ἐπιστρέφοντες τὰ ἀποπεπλανημένα, ἐπισκεπτόμενοι πάνας ἀσθενεῖς, μὴ ἀμελοῦντες χήρας ἢ ὀρφανοῦ ἢ πένητος· ἀλλὰ προνοοῦτες ἀεὶ τοῦ καλοῦ ἐνώπιον θεοῦ καὶ ἀνθρώπων, ἀπεχόμενοι πάσης ὀργῆς, προσωποληψίας, μὴ ταχέως πιστεύοντες κατά τινος, μὴ ἀπότομοι ἐν κρίσει, εἰδότες ὅτι πάντες ὀφειλέται ἐσμὲν ἁμαρτίας.

**\6:1:en.1** And let the presbyters be compassionate and merciful to all, bringing back those that wander, visiting all the sick, and not neglecting the widow, the orphan, or the poor, but always “providing for that which is becoming in the sight of God and man; “abstaining from all wrath, respect of persons, and unjust judgment; keeping far off from. all covetousness, not quickly crediting [an evil report] against any one, not severe in judgment, as knowing that we are all under a debt of sin.

**\6:2:en.2** And the presbyters [must] also [be] compassionate, merciful to all, turning back those who have gone astray, caring for all sick, neglecting neither widow or orphan or poor but always taking thought for the good before God and people, refraining from all anger, partiality, unjust judgment, being far removed from all love of money, not quickly believing against anyone, not relentless in judgment, understanding that we are all debtors [in the matter of] sin.

**\6:2:en.3** The elders, too, must be compassionate and merciful to all, bringing back those who have gone astray, visiting the sick, and not neglecting the widow, the orphan, or the poor. But they must always be concerned for the good before God and people, refraining from all anger, partiality, and unjust judgment, being far removed from all love of money, not quickly believing against anyone, not relentless in judgment, understanding that we are debtors to sin.

**\6:2:el**. εἰ οὖν δεόμεθα τοῦ κυρίου, ἵνα ἡμῖν ἀφῇ, ὀφείλομεν καὶ ἡμεῖς ἀφιέναι· ἀπέναντι γὰρ τῶν τοῦ κυρίου καὶ θεοῦ ἐσμὲν ὀφθαλμῶν, καὶ πάντας δεῖ παραστῆναι τῷ βήματι τοῦ Χριστοῦ καὶ ἕκαστον ὑπέρ αὐτοῦ λόγον δοῦναι.

**\6:2:en.1** If then we entreat the Lord to forgive us, we ought also ourselves to forgive; for we are before the eyes of our Lord and God, and “we must all appear at the judgment-seat of Christ, and everyone must give an account of himself.”

**\6:3:en.2** Therefore if we ask the Lord to forgive us, we are obligated to forgive also, for we are before the eyes of the Lord and God, and we must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ, and each must give an account of oneself.

**\6:3:en.3** If we ask the Lord to forgive us, we ourselves must forgive, for we are before the eyes of the Lord and God, and we must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ, and give an account of ourselves.

**\6:3:el** οὕτως οὖν δουλεύσωμεν αὐτῷ μετὰ φόβου καὶ πάσης εὐλαβείας, καθὼς αὐτὸς ἑνετείλατο καὶ οἱ εὐαγγελισάμενοι ἡμᾶς ἀπόσολοι καὶ οἱ προφῆται, οἱ προκηρύξαντες τὴν ἔλευσιν τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν· ζηλωταὶ περὶ τὸ καλόν, ἀπεχόμενοι τῶν σκανδάλων καὶ τῶν ψευδαδέλφων καὶ τῶν ἐν ὑποκρίσει φερόντων τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ κυρίου, οἵτινες ἀποπλανῶσι κενοὺς ἀνθρώπους.

**\6:3:en.1** Let us then serve Him in fear, and with all reverence, even as He Himself has commanded us, and as the apostles who preached the Gospel unto us, and the prophets who proclaimed beforehand the coming of the Lord [have alike taught us]. Let us be zealous in the pursuit of that which is good, keeping ourselves from causes of offence, from false brethren, and from those who in hypocrisy bear the name of the Lord, and draw away vain men into error.

**\6:3:en.2** So then, let us serve him with fear and all reverence, just as he himself has commanded, as did the apostles who proclaimed the gospel to us, and the prophets who publicly proclaimed the coming of our Lord. [Let us be] enthusiasts concerning the good, refraining from those who cause [others] to stumble and the false brothers and those bearing the name of the Lord in hypocrisy, who mislead foolish people.

**\6:3:en.3** So then, let us serve him with fear and all reverence, just as he himself has commanded, as did the apostles who proclaimed the gospel to us, and the prophets who publicly proclaimed the coming of our Lord.

## Chapter 7 Avoid the Docetae, and Persevere in Fasting and Prayer

**\7:1:el** Πᾶς γὰρ ὃς ἂν μὴ ὁμολογῇ Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν ἐν σαρκὶ ἐληλυθέναι, ἀντιχριστός ἐστιν· καὶ ὃς ἂν μὴ ὁμολογῇ τὸ μαρτύριον τοῦ σταυροῦ, ἐκ τοῦ διαβόλου ἐστίν· καὶ ὃς ἂν μεθοδεύῃ τὰ λόγια τοῦ κυρίου πρὸς τὰς ἰδίας ἐπιθυμίας καὶ λέγῃ μήτε ἀνάστασιν μήτε κρίσιν, οὗτος πρωτότοκός ἐστι τοῦ σατανᾶ.

**\7:1:en.1** “For whoever does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, is antichrist;” and whoever does not confess the testimony of the cross, is of the devil; and whoever perverts the oracles of the Lord to his own lusts, and says that there is neither a resurrection nor a judgment, he is the first-born of Satan.

**\7:1:en.2** For everyone who does not confess [that] Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is an antichrist, and whoever does not confess the testimony of the cross is from the devil, and whoever twists the sayings of the Lord for one's own sinful passions, and says [that there is] neither resurrection or judgment, this one is the firstborn of Satan.

**\7:1:en.3** For everyone who does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is an antichrist, and whoever does not confess the testimony of the cross is from the devil, and whoever twists the sayings of the Lord for one's own sinful passions, and says there is neither resurrection or judgment, is Satan's first-born.

**\7:2:el** διὸ ἀπολιπόντες τὴν ματαιότητα τῶν πολλῶν καὶ τὰς ψευδοδιδασκαλίας ἐπὶ τὸν ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἡμῖν παραδοθέντα λόγον ἐπιστρέψωμεν, νήφοντες πρὸς τὰς εὐχὰς καὶ προσκαρτεροῦντες νηστείας, δεήσεσιν αἰτούμενοι τὸν παντεπόπτην θεὸν μὴ εἰσενεγκεῖν ἡμᾶς εἰς πειρασμόν, καθὼς εἶπεν ὁ κύριος· Τὸ μὲν πνεῦμα πρόθυμον, ἡ δὲ σὰρξ ἀσθενής.

**\7:2:en.1** Wherefore, forsaking the vanity of many, and their false doctrines, let us return to the word which has been handed down to us from the beginning; “watching unto prayer,” and persevering in fasting; beseeching in our supplications the all-seeing God to “not lead us into temptation.” As the Lord has said: “The spirit truly is willing, but the flesh is weak.”

**\7:2:en.2** Therefore, leaving behind the idle speculation of the crowd and their false teachings, let us turn back to the word which was delivered to us from the beginning, being self-controlled with regard to prayer and being persistent in fasts, making petitions of the all-seeing God to lead us not into temptation, just as the Lord said, “The spirit [is]indeed willing, but the flesh [is] weak.”

**\7:2:en.3** Therefore, leaving behind the idle speculation of the crowd and their false teachings, let us turn back to the word which was delivered to us from the beginning, being self-controlled with regard to prayer and being persistent in fasts, making petitions of the all-seeing God to lead us not into temptation, just as the Lord said, “The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”

**\8:1:en.1** Let us then continually persevere in our hope, and the earnest of our righteousness, which is Jesus Christ, “who bore our sins in His own body on the tree,” “who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth,” but endured all things for us, that we might live in Him.

**\8:1:en.2** Therefore we should persevere unceasingly in our hope and down payment of our righteousness, which is Christ Jesus, who bore our sins in his own body on the tree, who committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth, but because of us, in order that we might live in him, endured all things.

**\8:2:el**. μιμηταὶ οὖν γενώμεθα τῆς ὑπομονῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐὰν πάσχωμεν διὰ τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, δοξάζωμεν αὐτόν. τοῦτον γὰρ ἡμῖν τὸν ὐπογραμμὸν ἔθηκε δι’ ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ήμεῖς τοῦτο ἐπιστεύσαμεν.

**\8:2:en.1** Let us then be imitators of His patience; and if we suffer for His name’s sake, let us glorify Him. For He has set us this example in Himself, and we have believed that such is the case.

**\9:2:en.1** [This do] in the assurance that all these have not run in vain, but in faith and righteousness, and that they are [now] in their due place in the presence of the Lord, with whom also they suffered.

**\9:2:en.2** 2 Having confidence that {none of them ran in vain}, but in faith and righteousness, and that they are with the Lord in the place {which they are due}, who they also suffered with. {For they did not love the present age}, but the one who died {on our behalf} and on account of us was raised up by God.

**\10:2:en.1** When you can do good, defer it not, because “alms delivers from death.” Be all of you subject one to another, having your conduct blameless among the Gentiles, that ye may both receive praise for your good works, and the Lord may not be blasphemed through you.

## Chapter 11 Exhortation of Grief on Account of Valens

**\11:1:la** Nimis contristatus sum pro Valente, qui presbyter factus est aliquando apud vos, quod sic ignoret is locum qui datus est ei. Moneo itaque ut abstinete vos ab omni malo.

**\11:1:en.1** I am greatly grieved for Valens, who was once a presbyter among you, because he so little understands the place that was given him [in the Church]. I exhort you, therefore, that ye abstain from covetousness, and that ye be chaste and truthful. “Abstain from every form of evil.”

**\11:1:en.2** I am deeply sorry for Valens, who was once a presbyter among you, that he so little understands the place which was given to him. I advise, therefore, that you keep from love of money, and be pure and truthful. Keep yourselves from all evil.

**\11:1:en.3** I am greatly grieved about Valens, who was once one of your elders, because he so little understands the place that was given him. I exhort you, therefore, to abstain from greed, and to be chaste and truthful. Abstain from every form of evil.

**\11:2:la** Qui autem non potest se in his gubernare, quomodo alii pronuntiat hoc? Si quis non se abstinuerit ab avaritia, ab idolotatria conquinabitur et tamquam inter gentes iudicabitur, qui ignorant iudicium domini. Aut nescimus, quia sancti mundum iudicabunt? sicut Paulus docet.

**\11:2:en.1** For if a man cannot govern himself in such matters, how shall he enjoin them on others? If a man does not keep himself from covetousness, he shall be defiled by idolatry, and shall be judged as one of the heathen. But who of us are ignorant of the judgment of the Lord? “Do we not know that the saints shall judge the world?” as Paul teaches.

**\11:2:en.2** 2 For how may he who cannot attain self-control in these matters preach it to another? If any man does not abstain from love of money he will be polluted by idolatry, and shall be judged as if he were among the Gentiles who know not the judgment of God. Or do we “not know that the saints shall judge the world”60 as Paul teaches?

**\11:2:en.3** For if you cannot achieve self-control in these matters, how can you preach it to others? If you do not abstain from greed, you will be polluted by idolatry, and shall be judged as if you were among the Gentiles who know not the judgment of God. Or do we not know that the saints shall judge the world as Paul teaches?

**\11:3:la** Ego autem nihil tale sensi in vobis vel audivi, in quibus laboravit beatus Paulus, qui estis in principio episulae eius. De vobis etenim gloriatur in omnibus ecclesiis, quae dominum solae tunc cognoverant; nos autem nondum cognoveramus.

**\11:3:en.1** But I have neither seen nor heard of any such thing among you, in the midst of whom the blessed Paul labored, and who are commended in the beginning of his Epistle. For he boasts of you in all those Churches which alone then knew the Lord; but we [of Smyrna] had not yet known Him.

**\11:3:en.2** But I have neither perceived nor heard any such thing among you, among whom the blessed Paul labored, who are praised in the beginning of his epistle. For concerning you he boasts in all the churches61 who then alone had known the Lord, for we had not yet known him.

**\11:3:en.3** But I have not seen or heard of any such thing among you, among whom the blessed Paul labored, who are praised in the beginning of his epistle. For concerning you he boasts in all the churches who then alone had known the Lord, for we had not yet known him.

**\11:4:la** Valde ergo, fratres, constristor pro illo et pro coniuge eius, quibus det dominus paenitentiam veram. Sobrii ergo estote et vos in hoc; et non sicut inimicos tales existimetis, sed sicut passibilia membra et errantia eos revocate, ut omnium vestrum corpus salvetis. Hoc enim agentes vos ipsos aedificatis.

**\11:4:en.1** I am deeply grieved, therefore, brethren, for him (Valens) and his wife; to whom may the Lord grant true repentance! ⁴ And be ye then moderate in regard to this matter, and “do not count such as enemies,” but call them back as suffering and straying members, that ye may save your whole body. For by so acting ye shall edify yourselves.

**\11:4:en.2** Therefore, brothers, I am deeply sorry for him and for his wife, may the Lord grant them true repentance. Therefore you yourselves should also be moderate in this matter, and do not regard such people as enemies, but call them back as fallible and straying members, that you may make whole the body of you all. For in doing this you edify yourselves.

**\11:4:en.3** I am very deeply grieved about Valens and his wife, to whom may the Lord grant true repentance.

For in doing this you edify yourselves.

## Chapter 12

**\12:1:la** Confido enim vos bene exercitatos esse in sacris literis et nihil vos latet; mihi autem non est concessum. Modo, ut his scripturis dictum est, irascimini et nolite peccare, et sol non occidat super iracundiam vestram. Beatus, qui meminerit; quod ego credo esse in vobis.

**\12:1:en.1** For I trust that ye are well versed in the Sacred Scriptures, and that nothing is hidden from you; but to me this privilege is not yet granted.

**\12:2:la** Deus autem et pater domini nostri Iesu Christi, et ipse sempiternus pontifex, dei filius Iesus Christus, aedificet vos in fide et veritate et in omni mansuetudine et sine iracundia et in patientia et in longanimitate et tolerantia et castitate; et det vobis sortem et partem inter sanctos suos et nobis vobiscum et omnibus, qui sunt sub caelo, qui credituri sunt in dominum nostrum et deum Iesum Christum et in ipsius patrem, qui resuscitavit eum a mortuis.

**\12:2:en.1** But may the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ Himself, who is the Son of God, and our everlasting High Priest, build you up in faith and truth, and in all meekness, gentleness, patience, longsuffering, forbearance, and purity; and may He bestow on you a lot and portion among His saints, and on us with you, and on all who are under heaven, who shall believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, and in His Father, who “raised Him from the dead.

**\12:2:en.2** 2 Now may God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the eternal Priest himself, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, build you up in faith and truth, and in all gentleness, and without wrath, and in patience, and in longsuffering, and endurance, and purity, and may he give you a share and place with his saints, and to us with you, and to all under heaven who shall believe in our Lord and God Jesus Christ and in his Father who raised him from the dead.

**\13:1:el** Ἐγράψατέ μοι καὶ ὑμεῖς καὶ Ἰγνάτιος, ἵν’, ἐάν τις ἀπέρχηται εἰς Σρίαν, καὶ τὰ παρ’ ὑμῶν ἀποκομίσῃ γράμματα· ὅπερ ποιήσω, ἐὰν λάβω καιρὸν εὔθετον, εἴτε ἐγώ, εἴτε ὃν πέμπω πρεσβεύσοντα καὶ περὶ ὑμῶν.

Et de ipso Ignatio et de his, qui cum eo sunt, quod certius agnoveritis significate.
